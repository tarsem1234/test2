        <h5>(a) STRUCTURAL AND OVERALL CONDITION OF THE PROPERTY</h5> <p> It is strongly recommended that you use the services of professional home inspectors, structural engineers, contractors, and other qualified specialists to evaluate the structural and overall condition of the property and its systems and components including, but not limited to, electrical, plumbing, water heating, roofing, air conditioning, heating, septic systems, wells, pools, appliances, etc. These professionals should also be utilized: to evaluate any damage from fire, wind, or hail; to advise you as to the condition, safety, and remaining useful life of any systems or components; to evaluate any water infiltration or moisture issues; to discover any hazardous property conditions; and to estimate any repair costs. Buyers should also conduct a final inspection, with inspectors, before closing.</p> 
        <p><b>NOTE: </b>Appraisals are different from home inspections. An appraisal is done to determine market value, not to evaluate the condition of the property. Appraisals, Seller's property condition disclosures, and Home Protection plans are not substitutes for a professional home inspection.</p>

To confirm that any septic systems are properly permitted for the actual number of bedrooms, it is recommended that Sellers and Buyers request a copy of the subsurface sewage disposal system permit from the appropriate governmental permitting authority. If such permit has not or cannot be located, you should seek professional advice regarding this matter.
