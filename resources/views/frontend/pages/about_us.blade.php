                        <p>Our value proposition is derived from the foundation of <span>“FREE” (Free-zylist)</span>, which is 
                            commonly interpreted in a financial sense; however, the most significant distinction
                            is the <span>freedom of choice and the ability to control one’s own path</span>.

                    </p>

                    </p>

                        The function of a Realtor is to deliver a <span>"Ready and Willing Buyer."</span>
                        As agents are specialists in marketing real property, they must rely on
                        the support of their network to facilitate the closing process.

                        <span>Our services re-create the Realtor Network model, with Home Owners at the center.</span>
                        We provide a marketing interface, a service provider framework, a network of peers
                        and neighbors, scheduling tools, communication channels, and an integrated solution
                        that can prepare your contracts and facilitate the signing process.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Further, <span>Exclusive Listing Agreements allow simultaneously listing "By Owner"
                            and with a broker.</span> We challenge Home Owners to leverage this opportunity to strengthen
                        agent performance and potentially avoid a large commission.
