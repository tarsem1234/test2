The appraised valuation is arrived at to determine the maximum mortgage the Department of Housing and Urban Development will insure. HUD does not warrant the value or the condition of the property. The purchaser should satisfy himself/herself that the price and condition of the property are acceptable." (HUD Handbook 4155.1 Chapter 3-4)</p>

VA and FHA appraisals are not intended to be "home inspections." VA and FHA appraisals, seller's property condition disclosures, and Home Protection Plans are not substitutes for a professional home inspection. Well, septic, wood destroying insect and other inspections or certifications may be required. The lender may also require that certain repairs or treatments be completed, or that the property be connected to public water or sewer if available and feasible. The costs of any such inspections, certifications, treatments, connections or repairs should be negotiated in the Purchase and Sale Agreement.</p>

These "non-allowable" charges must be paid by the seller or the lender. Any seller contributions to the buyer's closing costs (including the VA Funding Fee) must be addressed in the Purchase and Sale Agreement, and any non-allowable charges will be included in the total amount of any seller contributions negotiated.</p>
